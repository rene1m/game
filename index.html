    I want to make a game specifically made for the killer types. Probably a pvp game with 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5, where you can select a character and fight. There will be gamemodes such as completing an objective and whoever completes it, wins. Or a complete pvp based gamemode, where whoever has the most kills wins, or maybe add lives, such as 3-5 lives, and when those lives are up you lose.

    My definiton of a game, is a player based experience, where a person(s) can complete a certain objective, or play it for entertainment. 
    My gamer type is Killer 73$, Achiever 63%, 38% Socialiser, Explorer 26% 
    I don't have a favorite game, I don't play them much.
